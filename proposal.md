# TechDoctor Inventory Proposal

1. What are you going to create?
I am going to create an inventory tracker for repairing devices. MVP will be iPhones and its components

2. Why is it useful?
__v1.__ Huge companies keeps track of almost everything. This will give my feet wet on tracking parts
__v2.__ Will add a way for customers to schedule a repair
__v3.__ Will not accept customer's repair request if a component is missing
__v4.__ Will not accept customer's repair request if someone already scheduled a time
